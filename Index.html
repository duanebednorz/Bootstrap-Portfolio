      <p>This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. I don't like the look of this. Han Solo. I'm
        captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. Yes, indeed.
        If it's a fast ship. Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? Should I have? It's the ship that made
        the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
        I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? Only passengers.
        Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. What is it? Some kind of local trouble? Let's just say we'd
        like to avoid any Imperial entanglements yo.</p>

      <p>I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait
        here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
        But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich. Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to
        rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite
        a bit! You'll get it! I better! You will...</p>

      <p>What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base.
        Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always. That malfunctioning
        little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that?
        A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!</p>
